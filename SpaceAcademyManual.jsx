      brain of our operation. It uses advanced convolutional neural networks to process visual data from 
      the battlefield and make split-second decisions on how to respond to the alien threat.`

      content: `Just like our best pilots learn from past encounters, our AI system stores its experiences 
      in a special memory bank called the ReplayBuffer. This allows it to replay past battles and learn 
      from both victories and defeats, constantly improving its strategy.`

      actions (high epsilon) and gradually becomes more strategic (epsilon decay), learning to make better 
      decisions through experience and constant evaluation.`

      â€¢ Survival time optimization
      The system automatically saves its best configurations for future deployments.`
